# Time table System
The GUI Timetable System is a  C++ application designed to streamline the management of schedules and academic commitments. This project combines  a graphical user interface (GUI), a database backend, and user authentication features to provide a comprehensive solution for organizing and planning daily academic activities.

Database Integration: The system is connected to a MYSQL database to store and retrieve data efficiently.

User Authentication: The inclusion of a signup and login system enhances security. Users can create accounts and log in securely, allowing them to access their personalized timetables and planning features.

Dynamic Table Display: The core of the system is a dynamically generated table that visually represents the timetable. The table is coded from scratch to provide a customized and user-friendly interface. It displays modules in a structured format.

Module Placement: The system intelligently places registered modules in their respective time slots on the timetable. This automated placement ensures that the schedule is organized and easy to interpret, saving users time and effort.

Planning System: A planning system is incorporated, allowing users to set important events such as tests and deadlines. This feature helps users stay organized and be well-prepared for upcoming academic commitments.
